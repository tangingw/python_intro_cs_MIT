# Solutions (Might be correct but not optimized) for MIT [6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)

### Synopsis
This is the solution for MIT 6.0001 which I am currently following. Although I might have known most of the python knowledge delivered in the class, still I find that there is no harm to follow the class again. 

The problem is very interesting and challenging. Although it might not be as tough as some of the programming problems, still it allows you to think on how to write a better approach to solve the problems given.
